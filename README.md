I'm seeing a number of issues with the application.

- I get a diagnostic in the debug output window that says  
  something about a connection not being made from an action to a
  ViewController.
- Sometimes, the document Windows doesn't appear when the program
  starts. I can work around this issue by using File-New.
- Sometimes, the document window appears but it doesn't display the
  default list. I can work around this issue by adding an item.
  I can probably fix this issue by calling the method that redraws the
  UI when the application first launches.
